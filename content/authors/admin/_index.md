## About Me
üëãHi, I'm Bowen(Brian) Qu. My research interests include Vision-Language Model and MLLM Reasoning.

- **Education:** I'm an MPhil. Candidate at [School of Electronic and Computer Science (SECE)](https://www.ece.pku.edu.cn/en/), [Peking University (PKU)](https://english.pku.edu.cn/), since 2022 fall. Previously, I received the Honours B.E. degree at [School of Electronic Information and Communications (EIC)](http://ei.hust.edu.cn/), [Huazhong University of Science and Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) in June, 2022.
- **Experience:** Fortunately, I have the honor to participate in some interesting MLLM research projects:
  - [2024.05 - 2024.12] **01.ai & Rhymes.ai**, Multimodal Team, supervised by [Junnan Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MuUhwi0AAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=2), working closely with [Dongxu Li](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=h5XtaUUAAAAJ&hl=en&authuser=2) and [Haoning Wu](https://teowu.github.io/). *Output:* [Aria(multimodal native MoE)](https://github.com/rhymes-ai/Aria) [<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/rhymes-ai/Aria" style="width: auto; height: 20px; vertical-align: top; display: inline; margin: 0 2px;">](https://github.com/rhymes-ai/Aria) 
  - [2024.02 - 2024.07] **IDEA Research**, working closely with [Zhengzhuo Xu](https://xuzhengzhuo.com/), [Yiyan Qi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZG9GqnMAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Chengjin Xu](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=sIts5VgAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN). *Output:* [ChartMoE(ICLR2025 Oral)](https://github.com/IDEA-FinAI/ChartMoE) [<img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/IDEA-FinAI/ChartMoE" style="width: auto; height: 20px; vertical-align: top; display: inline; margin: 0 2px;">](https://github.com/IDEA-FinAI/ChartMoE)
- **Status:** I expect to receive a master's degree in June, 2025. I'm open to academic collaboration opportunities. Feel free to drop me an [üìß](mailto:brian.bw.qu@gmail.com) if there is a good fit!
